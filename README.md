# ReGambit  

## Planning Story

The idea for this application began from the mind of Julius. The Queens Gambit has become a streaming sensation and have inspired many to explore the world of chess. Online there are many great resources to learn the rules and opening/move sets, but none that are very interactive or have a community of users to discuss strategy with each other. That is were [ReGambit](https://github.com/Delusionaly-Tired/ReGambit-client) comes in, it is designed to be the missing link in helping the players of chess improve their skills and help build a strong community.  

This app is intended to be used with our [API](https://github.com/Delusionaly-Tired/ReGambit-API)

The app itself is relatively simple. A user signs up on the [website](https://delusionaly-tired.github.io/ReGambit-client/#/) and can add different chess openings and modify them at will. Each opening has its own properties which help users categorize the move-sets. The website makes request to the [back-end](https://aqueous-shelf-72255.herokuapp.com/) and handles all the openings from there.
