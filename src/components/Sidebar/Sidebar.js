    <h1>Dutch Defense</h1>
    <p>The Dutch Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:

    1. d4 f5

Black&apos;s 1...f5 stakes a claim to the e4-square and envisions an attack in the middlegame on White&apos;s kingside; however, it also weakens Black&apos;s kingside some (especially the e8â€“h5 diagonal). Like its 1.e4 counterpart, the Sicilian Defence, the Dutch is an aggressive and unbalancing opening, resulting in the lowest percentage of draws among the most common replies to 1.d4. Historically, White has tried many methods to exploit the kingside weaknesses, such as the Staunton Gambit (2.e4) and Korchnoi Attack (2.h3 and 3.g4).</p>
